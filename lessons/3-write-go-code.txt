Lesson 3 - How to write Go Code

* Go program structure
* Setting up the IDE
* Testing a simple code

Go workspace folders
* src folder: where all your source code will reside

* pkg folder: destination folder for package objects

* bin folder: where your built executables will reside

Your Go program

* Package main
    #Package p1
      - Package p4
    #Package p2
      - Package p5
    #Package p3
      - Package p6

Private or Public
SayHello - upper case, or camel case means it is exportable

sayhello - lower case is not exportable, not shared with other packages, can not access it. 

Go Tool
